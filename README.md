### Reflections and Comments

#### Learning Journal: 02

I see myself planning and evaluating my learning by being organized with my notes and staying focused on the lecture or lab. Today I felt like my notes were scattered between different places such as on replit, vs code, or my notebook. Finding a good singular place to put my notes during the lectures will help me stay organized and improve my learning. I also think staying focused on the task at hand, whether that's the lecture, the lab, or the reading, and not getting distracted by external things will help my learning as well. I did well today in that regard. I also think asking questions and finding the finer details of a concept will really help my learning as well. I'm hoping to evaluate my learning once a day to know if I did a good job learning the material taught that day. It is really interesting that adults are 100% in control of their learning. I find it so true that adults are motivated by intrinsic factors. Before being a student at Code Fellows, I was definitely motivated by extrinsic factors such as graduating and getting good grades. I was not motivated by my curiosity or passion or desire to use what I learn someday in the future.
