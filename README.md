### Reflections and Comments

#### Learning Journal: 02

I see myself planning and evaluating my learning by being organized with my notes and staying focused on the lecture or lab. Today I felt like my notes were scattered between different places such as on replit, vs code, or my notebook. Finding a good singular place to put my notes during the lectures will help me stay organized and improve my learning. I also think staying focused on the task at hand, whether that's the lecture, the lab, or the reading, and not getting distracted by external things will help my learning as well. I did well today in that regard. I also think asking questions and finding the finer details of a concept will really help my learning as well. I'm hoping to evaluate my learning once a day to know if I did a good job learning the material taught that day. It is really interesting that adults are 100% in control of their learning. I find it so true that adults are motivated by intrinsic factors. Before being a student at Code Fellows, I was definitely motivated by extrinsic factors such as graduating and getting good grades. I was not motivated by my curiosity or passion or desire to use what I learn someday in the future.

I definitely relate to the statement made above. I believe I learned more during my time at the company I was at before Code Fellows than during my time in college. This is because I am a hands-on learner. The experience I gain is more important to my learning. I think that my experiences at my previous company will help me in this new endeavor at Code Fellows because I learned how to manage my time and juggle multiple projects at once.  
Today was the hardest day so far at Code Fellows. I felt scattered when it came to learning loops and the logic behind them. I think it is because I tried to take notes as the teacher was teaching and got too focused on that, that I missed what she was actually trying to teach us. I need to learn when to pause my note-taking and just listen to really absorb the information being taught.

My main motivation for learning is to apply what I learn to my future work so that my work will be remarkable and make a difference in the lives of others. I also am motivated by my curiosity and passion for this subject. It's been one of my only passions so far in life and I want to make sure I learn as much as I can about it.Â  
Today went very well in terms of my learning. I felt like the material from yesterday really clicked today and I understood the material for today. I definitely focused on listening at certain points of the lecture where I was more shaky on the material instead of trying to take notes. This worked as I began to understand the material better.
